### Financial Data Analytics - Insurance Project

In this project, I performed the following tasks:<br>

* Queried a public dataset

This is a data analytics project that:<br>

* Discovered the underlying structure of the data.
* Looked for trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
* Tested hypotheses and validated assumptions about the data.

### About The Data Set:

This data set was taken from <br>

The data has the following features:<br>

* Age 
* Sex 
* BMI
* Smoker
* Region
* Charges

### Data Cleaning:
In this stage of the project, I cleaned the data and made specific changes like:<br>

* Removed duplicate or irrelevant observations
* Fixed the structural errors (naming convention, typos etc.)
* Filtered unwanted outliers
* Handled missing data
* Validated the data and performed QA

I asked the following questions:
* Does the data make sense?
* Does the data follow the appropriate rules for its field?
* Does it prove or disprove your working theory or bring any insight to light?
* Can you find trends in the data to help you form your next theory?
* If not, is that because of a data quality issue?

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
