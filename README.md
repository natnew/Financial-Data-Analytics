### Data Cleaning:
In this stage of the project, I cleaned the data and made specific changes like:<br>

* Removed duplicate or irrelevant observations
* Fixed the structural errors (naming convention, typos etc.)
* Filtered unwanted outliers
* Handled missing data
* Validated the data and performed QA

I asked the following questions:
* Does the data make sense?
* Does the data follow the appropriate rules for its field?
* Does it prove or disprove your working theory or bring any insight to light?
* Can you find trends in the data to help you form your next theory?
* If not, is that because of a data quality issue?
